### Assignment 02

Currently working:
1. Reading and displaying PPM images
2. Writing PPMs, both PPM and converted HDR
3. Tone mapping does *something*
4. Written questions completed

Not working:
1. HDR image reading might be broken?
2. HDR image writing might be broken? (not needed for assigment)
3. Tone mapping w/o filter gives odd result
4. Tone mapping w/ filter has a seg fault (think it has to do with edge case management)
